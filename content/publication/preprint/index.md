abstract: The sharing of personal health records can be beneficial to diagnosis and medical research. Currently most of the health record schemes are fully dependent on third-party
cloud service providers, which is not secure enough because there is a high risk of
leaking confidential health data. Blockchain provides a better solution for storing and
sharing data because of its decentralized and tamper-proof features. We proposed a
new Blockchain-based personal healthcare data storage and sharing scheme. We used
highly secure and efficient encryption-decryption mechanisms along with blockchain
to tackle the risk of privacy disclosure.
