abstract: Sharing of personal health records can be benefi-
cial in  diagnosis and medical research. Currently most
of the health record sharing schemes are fully dependent on
third party cloud service providers, which are not secure enough
as there is possibility of highly confidential health data getting
leaked. Blockchain provides a better solution for storing and
sharing personal health records because of its decentralized
and tamper-proof features. In this paper we propose a new
blockchain based personal healthcare data storing and sharing
scheme. We use highly secure encryption mechanism along
with blockchain to tackle the risk of privacy disclosure.
We use blockchain to manage keys in the scheme which
avoids any chance of single point of failure. According to
security analysis and performance evaluation, our scheme is
enough secure and very much feasible for practical use.
