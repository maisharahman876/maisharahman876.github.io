        I am so passionate about research. Though I have a full time job, I love to manage time for my research.
        Besides, my research interests align to my job. I leverage my extensive industry experience  to enrich my ongoing research endeavors. By integrating real-world challenges and insights gained from my professional work, I ensure that my research remains relevant, practical, and impactful.
