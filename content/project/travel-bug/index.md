Developed a website to make travelling easier. Here a user can host a travel experience
like hiking, snorkling, scuba diving etc. And the travellers can search and book their
preferred experiences according to budget, team size, duration etc. They can also pay
fully or partially. Besides, there is travelling guideline module where a user can search
for available transports providing source and destination locations on map. Then, the
website will provide all possible transportation choices like direct/indirect, mixed etc
with transportation costs.
